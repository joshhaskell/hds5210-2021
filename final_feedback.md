Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

I've been looking forward to reviewing this final and you didn't disappoint. Nice work!

Your worked through reading the data in very easily.  Did you pre-process these files or are these how they were all published by those hospitals?  Either way, the work you did here to combine so many files is great.

I found the first visualization (mean price by hospital) really interesting.  Obviously that must have a lot to do with WHICH procedures / DRGs they included in their data.  I can't believe the variation would be that dramatic based on hospital location alone.

That strip plot is a great tool to use for showing distributions.  I would have gone with the box/whisker plot you used first, but the strip plot you chose is probably even better!

Ah ha!  Yep.  You can see from the strip plot of "only those things < $1,000" that MO Delta Medical Center has a greater preponderance of lower cost things in its data.

So, overall, very well done with everything.  I would recommend breaking the data down to only those DRGs or CPTs that are common across all facilities that you're trying to compare.  That way, you know you're comparing "apples to apples".  That will keep the doctor of statistics away from criticizing the analysis.  (If you did something like this, I missed it).
