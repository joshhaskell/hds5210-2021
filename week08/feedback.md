Not sure if your comment was related to how you could query diffrent years, but it looks like you do that with the query string in the url.  If you select 2021 for example, you can see the URL changes to this: https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2021
